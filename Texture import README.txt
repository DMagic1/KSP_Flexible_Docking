FlexoDocking Installation Instructions


IMPORTANT - INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Some of the parts (see below) use some Squad textures.  Unfortunately, in 1.12, some
of the textures it uses have been moved into the zDeprecated directory, and are 
not directly accessible during loading.  This causes some textures to be missing.

To address this, I've provided a pair of scripts, one to be used on Windows and
 the other to be used on both Linux & OSX.  These only need to be run one time 


Windows Instructions
====================
Open the FlexoDocking folder in Windows Explorer
Double-click on the file Windows_CopyTextures.bat (note that on most systems,
you won't see the .bat)


Linux & OSX Desktop Instructions
================================
Open the FlexoDocking folder 
Double-click on the file:  BashCopyTextures.sh


Linux & OSX Terminal Instructions
=================================
Change to the GameData/FlexoDocking directory
Type the following:
	bash BashCopyTextures.sh
	

Affected Parts
==============
FlexoClampo
FlexoClampoJr
FlexoClampoSr


This patch includes patch files which update the part files included in the
mod
