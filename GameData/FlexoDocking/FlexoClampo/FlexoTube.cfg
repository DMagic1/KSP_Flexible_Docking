description = When a Maxo engineer found a Clamp-O-Tron lying by the side of the road a question occured, "What happens if both sides aren't lined up perfectly?" The answer, the Flex-O-Clamp-O-Tron: the proven design of the standard Clamp-O-Tron mated to a tough but flexible metallic mesh that allows for limited translation and rotation to facilitate docking in the field.
